        <h1>ITFS - Game Zone</h1>
        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>This project took place in April 2015. I was part of the Social Media team and collaborated with others as project management. The Game Zone was run by Hochschule Der Median as Part of the ITFS festival.</p>
        <p>The ITFS festival requested work to be done to ensure the festival was accessible to all international visitors. As part of the social Media team we were challenged to create content that not only advertised what was avalible during the week but also improved the accessibility of the Festival for German, English and other language speakers.</p>

        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>As part of the project management for The Game Zone I managed a team of over twenty students and worked with exhibitors to ensure their pieces of work were displayed in a way that improved a visitors understanding of their functionality, this meant I also had to be able to demonstrate and understand each piece of work. I was responsible for ensuring that the Games displayed were presented and understandable for non German speakers.</p>
        
        <p>As part of the Social Media team I was English presenter for a series of Vlog entries. I created content advertising the international appeal of the festival and that focussed on ensuring the Festival was accessible for non German Speakers.</p>

        <h3>The Result</h3>
         
        <p>Social Media content created gained on average 1000 views through facebook, twitter and youtube. As a result The Game Zone attracted the Presenters of popular German game Vlog “Rocket Beans ” to create a piece on his visit.</p>
