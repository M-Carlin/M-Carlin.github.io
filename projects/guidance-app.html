        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    		<p>This project took place between October 2015 and Febuary. I worked on this project as User Ecperience Designer For The Hochschule Der Medien Stuttgart in Collaboration With ITFS Stuttgart.</p>
    		
    		<p>ITFS approached The Hochschule Der Medien for help to redesign the current Festival app guide. We were challenged to create a gamification concept including high fidelity graphical prototypes. The prototype should not only provided the user with all relevent information but also encouraged them to explore areas of the festival that otherwise they may not have visited.</p>

        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>I was part of a small interdisiplinary team overseen by Prof Sabiha Ghellal. I was responsible for the layout and stucture of the pages and their content, ensuring that they were user friendly by applying user cented design principles. I Optimised Navigation options for the interface and the user interactions to ensure ease of use and clear functionality. I also carried out user testing, this included interviews and eyetracking. The results of this were used to further improve the design of the Graphical Prototypes.</p>
  		
        <h3>The Result</h3>
    		<p>Preliminary meetings with representatives from the festival went well. Our approach to the brief was to create a location based game where users ulocked content by visiting festival locations. User feedback was also positive, with the consensus being that we had created a prototype for an app that was attractive and appealing to use. The App was due to be released in the App store in 2016 .</p>
    		
    		<p>Due to my work on this project I was asked to participate in the Festival in April.</p>
