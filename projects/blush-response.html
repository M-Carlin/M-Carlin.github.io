        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    		<p>This project took place between September and December 2016. Edinburgh Napier University requested a creative computing exhibit to run concurrently with an exhibit of the same name by Creative Scotland.</p>
    		
    		<p>The Exhibit was to be on the theme of architexture and feature works by creative computing students, especially students from the courses “Interactive Media Design” and “Digital Media”. It would Run on the 17th and 18th of December, and include a private viewing evening which would double as a networking event.</p>

      <h3>My Role</h3>
    		<p>As project manager I had to ensure the exhibit from start to end ran smoothly.</p>
    		
    		<p>I worked to ensure that the users journey through their experience of the Exhibit was as cohesive as possible. For the exhibit there were two different user stories which heavily relied on the communication. of information. I had to ensure that in both user cases this was hapening in the most effective manner.</p>
    		
    		<p>For students exhibiting their work, and for other members of the team it was important for deadlines to be clear and descisions to be reported. Using Excel I managed and presented timelines and a facebook group allowed me to share information.</p>
    		
    		<p>For visitors it was important to present a strong common theme and make information accessible by ensureing the works presented. I oversaw the creation of social media platforms and a website to represent the exhibit.</p>
